Our customers  are waiting 10-15 min for a workflow to even start which impacts our business even more now because we have employees who now work for Cerner and some of these request offerings now go over to Remedy. With the delay not all the information crosses over because Remedy only does a 5 minute look back to capture the Note/Attachment data.

Thank you for the explanation of how Ivanti Patch functions within SCCM. The information you provided was crucial to ensuring that Ivanti Patch worked as advertised in our environment. However, I must express the frustration I feel at the process it took to receive this information. Expecting users to search the web outside of your support site, and to continuously prod product support personnel to get to these answers is bordering on absurd. It would be very helpful and a great service to your customers if the required ports, share permissions, NTFS permissions, and WSUS website authentication method were clearly accessible on your support site and in your documentation. Doing so would greatly reduce the amount of our time spent in troubleshooting and resolution would have been greatly reduced.

 It does appear that the issue has been resolved. Our SCCM ecosystem will run its scheduled sync schedule tonight. Following this our ADR's will run. Assuming functions as expected we should be able to close this case tomorrow.

The following specifics were what solved the permissions issues for the errors that I reported to you:

 1. Navigate to ""C:\WSUS\UpdateServicesPackages"" and ""C:\WSUS\WsusContent"" (or appropriate locations for your system, mine were different) then Share the directory and set permissions to:
 Admin's Group Full access
 Network Service Full access
 Everyone Read access
 WSUS Administrators Group Full access.

2. Set NTFS permissions to:
 Administrators Group Full access
 Network Service Full access
 System Full access
 Users Group Read/List Folder Read & Execute
 WSUS Admins Group Full access

 3.  Edit Anonymous Authentication for the IIS website (by right clicking) and change it from a Specific User to Application pool identity.",1,0011300001l4FXjAAM

The fact that there was an Ivanti kb article available which pointed to the cause and resolution for the entire duration of the case, is frankly appalling.
As you also control the AntiVirus which was the root cause of the issue makes me wonder how joined up the Ivanti family of products is, Perhaps you should have retained the support function in Ireland, where at least they appeared to understand their product.",2,0013000000eaqzJAAQ

I don't think the support portal is as user friendly as it should be.  The selection of knowledge articles that appeared when I was initially logging my issue bore no resemblance to what I was asking.   
Regarding the product (Service Desk, formerly Landesk Service Desk), 
I am VERY disappointed in the lack of progress in the Workspaces environment.  I was assured by my account manager that Ivanti would continue to develop both the Service Desk and Heat products, but it seems that Service Desk is getting no more than bug fixes, and not even that in Workspaces which can't even handle a user clicking a link to a specific form properly. - surely you can make it default to the person's home page when they click submit on a linked form.

1. Requiring the launching of SCCM as Administrator seems to be a flaw in design, other SCCM plug-ins do not require this practice.  
2. there should be a non-server plug-in for Ivanti.  Per SCCM practice not all users are allowed to access the server itself.  This plug-in requires server access.

2)  There should be FAQs or Knowledge Documents available that provide supported version information and a statement on upcoming support for newer version, for example SQL2016, Windows Server 2016, and .NET 4.7.1 support.   If a new version is not included in the road map then a blanket statement should be available in the knowledge / faq / community forum to safe time & effort for ivanti support, development, partners, and clients.      
3)  The community would have been a great place to post the question for 4.7.1 .NET Support so that it's available for future reference but sometimes community forum questions go unanswered.  Would be nice to have dedicated ivanti resources monitoring unanswered questions and/or to promote a community forum question to a support case.

If settings are changed  without the customer understanding the impact things end up going sideways",5,0011300001uiO4LAAU

I tried to activate a new 25 seat license automatically- it failed so I needed to get the text file sent to support.  I called and the agent gave me an email to send the activation txt file to then closed my case and our call ended.  
When I call, I expect the person who answers to either 1. own my issue and see it thru to resolution or 2. pass me directly to someone who can help me directly. 
At this point, I've contacted support, had a case opened and then closed and I've sent an email to a generic activation email with absolutely no ETA at all and I still have my original issue and now, I'm off the support scope- as fas as Ivanti knows...this was an FCR and my issue is fixed when in fact, it is not.

And with almost all solutions provided by Ivanti, I'm told to check out the community.  This is all user based and takes a very long time to find relevant material.  In my case I was told that I needed specifically a Win10 driver for the version of VMWare that I was using but no one (either the Ivanti community or the web)  would tell where to get the Win10 driver other than to check the VMWare Tools folder that is on the VM.  This was coming from a Win10 VM but the folder that the driver I needed was labeled as a Win8 driver.  So I guess the bottom line would be why tell people to use a Win10 driver and then not provide the driver?  Of course I could also point a finger at VMWare for not having the right drivers for their product as well.",1,0013000000jLXfoAAG

In this case I discovered an issue with the procedure of enrolling an ivanti core with Apple's DEP. I eventually re-built the connector and that solved the issue but this type of "gotcha" should be listed in the documentation. Also there is little to no documentation on the DEP settings that can be selected/deselected on the core. Namely the USB setting. I found out the hard way this blocks restoring using iTunes.,6,0013000000eamV9AAI

When we tried to obtain the license we received an error message and the program wiped out all of our licenses so we were in a ""system down state""   We called support and were told that there were only 2 Password Central support people with one on vacation and one in Germany.  The tech said he would get with his manager and call us back.  We were left to troubleshoot the issue on our own and eventually completed the offline registration.  When we called back about 30 minutes after the tech said he was going to talk with his manager he said, ""I was just about to call  you"".  But he did not offer any help or explain what we could do to resolve situation.  We explained that we had done the offline license request.  The license group did get back to us in less than 5 minutes and we were able to install the license - once again we were left to read the instructions on-line with no guidance from the tech on the phone.  After uploading the file to our system it still did not work.  We had to do some more troubleshooting to figure out that we needed to reboot the services - again it would have been helpful for the tech on the phone to offer this advice.  I am disappointed and very frustrated that in a system down situation we received little to no help.  I feel like we were left to troubleshoot this issue on our own and quite frankly question why we should continue to pay for support.

The actual explanation should have been that in order to receive a serial number update, one must select a specific non-intuitive set of options from the dropdown list(s) when creating the support case.

A single sentence explaining that (whether from the engineer or in the linked article) would have been ideal.

From the outside perspective, we are simply submitting a common request to support that should be easily handled -- whether by the initial rep who receives the request or by the person to whom that individual forwarded what they perceive as a misdirected incoming request to.",,0011300001uiEcVAAU

What I struggled with was the 1st webex was scheduled to take place and went on for 2 1/2 hours (I have no issue with how long it takes) but at the end of it I was left not being able to log back into the console as myself, I had to go back over the work that was done to reverse it so I could which I don't believe I should have to do. I was also told that a webex would take place at 8.30am the next day but was sent an email instead with x3 actions that I needed to take first. No major issue with that as they were simple and straight forward. It would have been nice to have received an update as to what was happening as I had to escalate the case to our account manager as I wasn't sure what was happening as 1 1/2 hours had gone by with no update.
I do thank support for the work that they do but it would have been nice to receive an email advising that they were working on possible scenarios/research on causes of this issue, instead it felt like I was being left in the dark.",,0013000000xHS1eAAG

For example I have to create a web form just to update the status of a computer instead right clicking and edit and changing the status from loaner to  repair or decommissioned.  This is my biggest issue with LANDesk. If JAMF managed Windows PCs I'd probably recommend  switching over. So many things that are already build in that platform and don't require extra steps like they do on LANDesk. That's my biggest issue with the suite, I create a webform I can change data when the machine checks in the status is updated and shows on the suite...sooo why can't certain fields be editable and function the same way, pushed to the machine at next check in.

I have one that has a whole slew of devices that don't fit the options available for answerback and will change on the fly.  Thanks!,,001a000001CYKeqAAH

Before upgrading I contacted support to make sure I wouldn't run into problems. I was assured everything was fine and our license was good for the new version. After discovering 3 weeks after the upgrade that I was not receiving new patch downloads (which the program did not alert me to!), I opened a ticket. The support person called and then passed the ticket on to the license group. I NEVER heard back on that ticket. The next morning, I opened a CRITICAL ticket, received an email from support that it was a license issue and they would contact me. Again, I heard NOTHING. I finally found a phone number of our account exec. She was no longer with the company, but I did get a reply from the area manager (Paul Aceves). He said he would figure it out and get back to me. Again, I HEARD NOTHING!! Finally, on Monday, the issue was fixed on IVANTI'S SIDE.",,001a000001WFaTfAAL

When searching a way to subscribe to newsletters the forums recommend to contact support, contacting support.  Not sure why there isn't a subscribe link of some sort on the forums or within the support portal, but there should be.    

Logging in to go through the spiel of asking to be subscribed, getting redirected to someone and 5 emails is a little counter productive.     That's just for 1 person.   

As a partner we have dozens of accounts , multiply that by contacts that ask us if there is a newsletter.  Asking them to phone support for the newsletter leaves a sour note and will tie up support unnecessarily.    I'm sure the ivanti support team is busy enough handling actual support issues.

Please look into this and offer an opt-in link of some sort for the newsletter(s).",,0013000000dqQAYAA2

The support staff for the ISM product are great, but the new support site is a huge downgrade from the one Heat used to provide, which ran on the ISM product. It is much more difficult to submit an incident online; it takes too many clicks, more time, and is far less intuitive.

As a side-item, the ""callback"" function on your new support site, apparently does not pass the selected phone number to the engineer.

It's not only inaccurate with this item but also our Rep told us that our 2017.3.1 release to PRD is not Feb 16 but Feb 9. The calendar and notices do not reflect that so it is very difficult to know which one is accurate. Lately the communication and service has felt very disorganized and everyone guessing at what is and is not correct.

What definately needs approvement is the way that support can be contacted.
With formal RES, you could call the Support Desk and an Engineer was available. Now with Ivanti, it is very unclear what to do and how to get support with all the different screens in field that you have to fill in. This is most certainly NOT a good customer experience and we urge you to follow the process as RES did previously. It should NOT be the case that a customer is not willing to contact Ivanti when it such a problem.

Also, Remote support was never an issue, and now our proxy is not accepting the new way of remote toolling.. Thanks to Dennis we could still an old toolling in order for Dennis to provide support.",,0011B00001IwC90QAF

Very impressed with the support engineer, thank you, thank you, you're the greatest.
 
Cons: 

I realize you guys just took over supporting this product, I'm totally not mad and sorry if this list sounds kind of brutal. Thanks for understanding.  

Not very impressed with the website/phone system. The form murdered a very detailed problem description when uploading an image in Firefox 57. All text was destroyed when the image populated. Also, last time I called in I called the old Front Range number. I held for a while before the phone robot told me to call another number--why did I have to hold for a robot? I called the other number which informed me all support must be initiated at a long URL, but the phone robot hung up on me and did not repeat the URL so I had to Google it. Meanwhile, it was unclear that old accounts from Front Range were retained, so it was difficult to get logged in. 
The actual form for submitting the support request was kind of obtuse, ""customer reference"" (if I recall) doesn't mean anything to me so I put in an identifying number I thought *could* be what you wanted. Maybe an example of desired input would help? And finally, there was another field that corresponded with the end of the Goldmine version (eg. 172, if I recall), but it was entirely unclear to me what was being requested. It took some time to examine things like the version number and figure it out. Although I could upload images, I was surprised to learn I could not upload .txt files (logs). I wanted to provide installed updates and system information. I was pretty sure it was a Windows Update issue and thought it would be handy to provide a complete list of installed updates and dates.

I support customers on the phone, trying to wade through all that and get a support ticket open, especially last time, took a really long time. It's a semi-urgent issue I want to focus on, but I cannot prevent new phone calls from coming in. Not being able to call a number and take myself out of the queue is big challenge for me. 

I'm sorry this was long a complainy-pants, I appreciate you muddling through all that. I hope some of my feelings prove useful as you take over support of this product.",,0011300001uiIpOAAU

In addition, multiple products have similar functions that go by similar names.  As a result, when searching the site, it's not easy to determine if you're looking at the correct instructions or at the information for a similar product.  Searching also brings up outdated pages, or multiple versions of the same page.  This makes self-education and self-support very difficult. 

The worst page is the this one https://landeskcommunity.force.com/customers/community_logcase_step1 with a drop-down list of product names that don't relate to anything we have installed.

My suggestion is to create a reference page for long-time customers who need help translating original product names to current names.

1) I was redirected to the new site, but it wasn't clear if my old account transferred or not, and it took several tries to get an account created and logged in.
2) I had multiple instances where a page would not submit because of either a required field or some formatting protections, but I did not get an error explaining which field was bad or why. I just had to guess a bit or keep clicking on things until the button ungreyed or the form submitted.
3) This was exacerbated by layouts with huge type and lots of white space, where the submit button was far away from most of the data. Maybe there were error messages, and I just couldn't see them.

On the plus side, I did find it much more intuitive trying to identify the Heat product, version, and module that was having an issue. The old site didn't do that nearly as well, so that's a plus.",,0011300001uiMIfAAM

One point of constructive criticism would be on the licensing side. It took multiple revisions of licenses to get our airgap HEAT EMSS software licensed, to the point where the software actually expired before we received the correct licenses. Due to compliance requirements that our company is under (NERC CIP), if your application control had stopped working when the licenses expired we would have faced severe penalties. I 'm not sure what went on behind the scenes during the license generation process, but it might be beneficial to document what happened on your side to resolve this issue so that we don't run into the same issue next year. Overall, we're very happy with the support we have received with Ivanti though.Thanks and happy New Year!",,0011300001uiPXNAA2

When we looked at purchasing the product, we weren't made aware that the product only worked correctly on the newest browsers. We're a hospital group - people's lives depend on specific software working correctly 110% of the time, not 90% with the occassional error/crash that is acceptable for most software. This means we're usually a browser version or two behind because the life-saving software working correctly trumps all other software. As we are a group of hospitals, it also means our staff rarely have the time or inclination to constantly change from the default browser to an alternative browser (many of which aren't allowed in our environment due to security issues with the browser which leaves hackers a way to gain access to our servers and steal patient data). This lowers the value of HEAT for us as I now have 8900+ staff who are less likely to use Self Service as it doesn't function correctly on the default browser and they have to do extra work to access a different browser. Doctors and nurses measure the worth of putting in a request against the amount of time it takes them away from a patient - extra work to put in a request means more time away from the patient, and the patient always comes first.",,0011300001uiJZdAAM

They loudly yawned multiple times down the phone and when questioned about what investigations they had carried out, they couldn't tell me whether they had looked through one or more of the logs I sent through (I sent through multiple - only some were affected by the issue we raised). When asking questions about Appsense and the processes involved at login, I received very vague responses that didn't really answer my questions.
I found the telephone conversations rather difficult all in all.

a0k1B000006MVsUQAW,2017-09-01 13:41:53.000,5001B00000UNdYrQAL,3,"The reasons for being somewhat dissatisfied with the software include : 

The test to live application is so unreliable it's getting to the point we can no longer know if we will be able to deploy changes on our scheduled change dates.  We now must spend an entire day trying to test before a live migration event cutting back on our development time.  We've had to write SSIS packages to perform steps the migrator should be doing just to be able to use the tool.

The follow-up form Ivanti on support issues is disappointing.  Often, we must ask multiple times for updates to our issues and in between the follow-up, which can be weeks at a time, we have to recover the same things multiple times sometimes with multi people sometimes with the same person.

We are struggling with form alignment in the application/window designer, it seems anytime we make a change to some forms it throws the field alignment.   Sometimes we can identify the cause quickly other times we spend several hours to days trying to fix the alignment issues, despite making no changes to a particular group box we find after hiding all sections and enabling one by one some group box on the form is causing the issue. 

Often, we hear we are the first to do or report some issue, sometimes it's surprising as big as Ivanti is that other customers have not reported some of these issues.  Examples include multi-select fields not working properly, adding a service catalog item to the configuration management module, showing hyperlinks on the configuration item field or raised user field thus causing additional issues, adding attachments while using the service catalog, unable to uninstall an installation of the software without creating new VM's, as well as various other issues all which we have had support tickets on.",,001a000001PAtTvAAL

In addition to that, the 1703 release isn't even supported in that context, and despite it's release almost 4 months ago there's absolutely no information on the support site about how to do and upgrade with it in LANDesk.",,0013000000eaiGSAAY

Overall we, our company and our client, have been very disappointed by the feature gap between the WindowsCE and Android versions of the Velocity client.  The Android version's launch seems rushed and largely incomplete because a large amount of critical features are still missing in the Android client.  Some functionality is able to be re-implemented via configuration and scripting, but they are not always equivalent; and the work involved being shifted to the user (rather than being a native behavior) is not appreciated.",,001a000001GZP7VAAX

Der Fokus ist nicht auf Bestandsicherung ausgelegt, sondern auf Weiterentwicklung die wir bei uns nicht einsetzen k√∂nnen. Der aktuelle Stand ist, das wir weder auf Workspaces updaten k√∂nnen, noch Webacces fehlerfrei einsetzen k√∂nnen. Leider sind auch ""Features"" hinzugekommen die das Arbeiten mit LanDesk erschweren, aber leider als Feature gesehen werden. => Keine separaten Import Log Dateien mehr, sondern ein zentrales un√ºbersichtliches log mit allen Importen. Bitte mehr auf die Verf√ºgbarkeit vorhandener Funktionalit√§ten achten und diese nicht entfernen. 
Aktuell m√ºssen wir 3 Oberfl√§chen nutzen, damit LanDesk funktioniert:
Webaccess f√ºr die Anwender
Console zum Administrieren
Workspaces f√ºr die Weitere Entwicklung und sp√§tere Nutzung.
Bitte den Focus darauf richten, das es EINE Oberfl√§che gibt die Die vorhandenen Funktionalit√§ten aus 7.x und Webaccess beinhaltet und mit der auch s√§mtliche Administration m√∂glich ist. Besten Dank!
